Determining the price of a stock is a complex task that depends on various factors, such as revenue, profits, losses, company news, public perception, and future business prospects. An essential aspect of stock pricing is the company's growth in profit and revenue. If a company reports good profits and revenue, the stock price is expected to increase, while poor financial results may lead to a decrease in stock price.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and comparing the stock prices and revenue of two popular stocks, Tesla and GameStop. Both of these companies have garnered significant attention in recent times for different reasons. Tesla is known for its electric vehicles and innovation in the automobile industry, while GameStop became one of the fastest-rising and popular stocks of the year due to unique market dynamics.
